(b) If there are non-committed issues with a file, it can be restored to the last 
    committed state using `git restore <file>`. 

(c) Merging changes is often seamless. If the commits in the remote do not conflict with
    commits in the local repository, a `git pull` will automatically merge the changes
    and bring the local repository up-to-date. If there are conflicts, foo bar baz bad!
