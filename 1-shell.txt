(a) There are two ways to run executables (commands) in the shell. The first is by 
    invoking the executable with its path, relative or absolute. Calling an executable
    in the current working directory is an example of this: for example, running `./a.out`
    in the shell will invoke the executable based on its relative path. The second way to
    run commands is without using their path. When you run `ls`, you are not giving the 
    shell a path. The shell instead searches for an executable with that name in all of 
    the directories listed in the `$PATH` environment variable.  

(b) In order to find a hidden file, a quick shortcut that may work is to look around
    using `ls -A`. If there are too many directories or files to look through, such that
    manual searching is not fast or easy, using the tool `find` works well. `find` works
    on hidden files. For information on how to use `find`, see `man find`.
   
(c) To concatenate two files, the `cat` utility can be used. By default, `cat` outputs
    the concatenation to stdout. We can use redirection, `>`, to redirect the
    concatenation to a new file `file3`. The full command is: `cat file1 file2 > file3`.
